    seoMetaDescription: "Explore smart grid fault mitigation and cybersecurity via Wide-Area Measurement Systems (WAMS)—upgrading traditional grids to resilient, real-time monitored infrastructure for global energy stability.",
    abstract: `Smart grid reliability and efficiency are critical for uninterrupted service, especially amidst growing demand and network complexity. Wide-Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are valuable tools for mitigating faults and reducing fault-clearing time while simultaneously prioritizing cybersecurity. This review looks at smart grid WAMS implementation and its potential for cyber-physical power system (CPPS) development and compares it to traditional Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure. While traditionally used in smart grids, SCADA has become insufficient in handling modern grid dynamics. WAMS differ through utilizing phasor measurement units (PMUs) to provide real-time monitoring and enhance situational awareness.

    This review explores PMU deployment models and their integration into existing grid infrastructure for CPPS and smart grid development. The review discusses PMU configurations that enable precise measurements across the grid for quicker, more accurate decisions. This study highlights models of PMU and WAMS deployment for conventional grids to convert them into smart grids in terms of the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM). Examples from developing nations illustrate cybersecurity benefits in cyber-physical frameworks and improvements in grid stability and efficiency. Further incorporating machine learning, multi-level optimization, and predictive analytics can enhance WAMS capabilities by enabling advanced fault prediction, automated response, and multilayer cybersecurity.`,
